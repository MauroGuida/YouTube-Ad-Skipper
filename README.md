# yt-ad-autoskipper

Original Developer [squgeim](https://github.com/squgeim)

YouTube Ad Skipper is an extension that auto mutes ads and auto skips them if possible. It does not block an ad but mutes it.

This is useful when you are watching a YouTube video (or a playlist), and an ad starts playing. YouTube allows you to skip the ad after 5 seconds, but if you can't be bothered to click it yourself (or you are AFK), this extension clicks that button for you.
